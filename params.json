  "body": "\r\n***\r\n### I About \r\n\r\nN-framework: a SCSS-learning and practice experience with the intent to be used in the author's personal projects. \r\n\r\nTo install, export the project files, run `grunt compile`, and load `/style/css/index.css` for direct use on your page.\r\n\r\n***\r\n### II Contexts\r\n\r\nThe framework covers three style contexts, which can be mixed and matched. \r\n\r\nThe following contexts will be included:\r\n\r\n* Linear [Default]\r\n\r\nMost apparent in form settings, the linear context prioritizes a clean UI, with whitespace as the primary method of distinguishing between areas. \r\nIn addition to whitespace, the linear context can use subtle distinctions in background color to delineate block level elements.\r\nTo mark a block element, typically a left or top border in a contextual color is used. \r\nThe linear context avoids shadows, and never uses more than one side of a block for a border.\r\n\r\n* Squared [Coming soon]\r\n\r\nThe squared context uses four-sided 'boxes' to segregate content. Background colors differ from the main page background only in specially assigned cases ('context boxes'). Square elements are preferred, but other geometric shapes are available for marking list items, input elements and presenting images.\r\n\r\n* Smooth [Coming soon]\r\n\r\nThe smooth context uses border radius and :before and :after pseudoclasses, and uses shadow to suggest a three-dimensional space. The model defaults to top-left 45 degree light source, and can be globally configured to provide a different source of lighting (top, left, right and bottom only).\r\n\r\nLines are avoided in the smooth model and shades and hues are used to provide distinction between elements.\r\n\r\n## III Vertical rhythm\r\n\r\nThe framework provides some tools to establish vertical rhythm. \r\nIt uses the Sassline library for the baseline grid (source: https://github.com/jakegiltsoff/sassline).\r\nThe desired ratios inspired by the modular scale are set up for all three contexts and should be used to set margins and padding. \r\nThey are included by default in the framework's available grid and component classes.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### IV Typography\r\n\r\nThree different type sets are suggested for the three contexts. CDN or self-hosted webfonts can be set in the type SCSS partial, but the three families are used by default:\r\n\r\n* Linear\r\nSans-serif fonts are used exclusively in the linear model, imagined as a flat material design offshot. It uses Christian Robertson's Roboto, in Slab and Normal.\r\n\r\nRoboto Slab: https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto+Slab\r\n\r\nRoboto: https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto\r\n\r\nSource: @import url(https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto|Roboto+Slab&subset=latin-ext);\r\n\r\n* Squared\r\nThe squared model uses Droid Sans for body type, and Oswald for headings, labels and captions.\r\n\r\nOswald: http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Oswald\r\n\r\nDroid Sans: http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Droid+Sans\r\n\r\nSource: @import url(https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Droid+Sans|Oswald&subset=latin-ext);\r\n\r\n* Smooth\r\nBy default, in this proto-version of the framework, I use Vernon Adam's Muli as a display font, paired with Cyreal's Lora in the body. \r\n\r\nMuli: https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Muli\r\n\r\nLora: https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Lora\r\n\r\nSource: @import url(https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lora|Muli&subset=latin-ext);\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Issues and bug reporting\r\n\r\n\r\nSend an e-mail to [nusa.babic@outlook.com](nusa.babic@outlook.com) for suggestions and to report significant oversights.
